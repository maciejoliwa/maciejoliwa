### Hello, I'm Maciej Oliwa,

I'm an ambitious programmer that likes to create things from scratch.
I've been learning *JavaScript* for 4 years now, I also have a lot of experience in *Python* and *Clojure.*<br>
I recently started learning the **C programming language** in order to better understand how the computer and memory works. 

#### JavaScript / TypeScript
I love JavaScript for the ability to fast prototype and visualize my ideas. I love the way asynchronous programming is handled by JavaScript and browsers. Altough I mainly use JavaScript and TypeScript with Node, I sometimes like to have fun developing my own libraries/frameworks.

#### Clojure
I'm a big fan of functional programming, and Clojure is an excellent language for that. It's fast, has great async support and makes development way waster. I mainly use Clojure for data processing.

#### The C programming language
I fell in love with **C**, it is a great and extremely capable language. It teaches me how to efficently use the memory. I love developing data structures, games and data processing software. My ultimate goal is to write a simple operating system in C.

### Something about me:
* I prefer functional programming to object-oriented programming,
* I love foxes and dogs,
* I love creating stuff from scratch,
* I'm working on my own programming language in C,
